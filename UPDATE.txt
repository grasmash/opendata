Updating Open Data
==================================

This module supplies [features](https://drupal.org/project/features) to define
required content types and views. When new versions of Open Data are released,
changes to these features may be included. To apply these updates, you will need
up to update the Open Data module and [revert](https://drupal.org/node/582680)
the affected features via the UI or [Drush](https://drupal.org/project/drush).
